    <head>
        This is our main alert call function for using the alert function and calling it. Clearly this is a bit different than our normal.
    </head>
<body>
    <script>
        var a = 100
        function addnumbers(a, b)
        {
            sum=a+b
            return sum
        }
        alert(addnumbers(4, 5));
    </script>
    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    Arrays can also look like this:
    
    var demo=["apples", "mangos"];
    var demo = new Array("apple", "mangos");
    
    this are giving an array the variables during creation. later you could add an a variables into the array if you would like like.
    
    var demo = new Array()
    demo[0]="apple"
    
    this will create an empty array and add a variable within the array known as apple. arrays always start at 0 = 1
